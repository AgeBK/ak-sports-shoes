# NextJS + React + RTK + TypeScript

## About

I built this e-Commerce site just for a bit of coding practice. I've built a lot of websites similar to this one. The main e-Commerce site I've built can be viewed here <a target="_blank" href="https://ak-fine-wines-ts.netlify.app/">AK Fine Wines</a>

Here's a link to the code base for the sports shoes site: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AgeBK/ak-sports-shoes">GitHub</a>

I wrote all of the code (JS/CSS/HTML) myself. The site uses RTK and Postgres as well.

## Description

I've built a shopping cart as well which you can add products to. The cart uses RTK which can be accessed anywhere in the site. You can increase and decrease amounts and enter a correct discount code. Calculations are automatically made in the cart for a variety of discounts that apply to a range of many products. The idea being that the user can have a simulated on-line shopping experience.

## Features

- Over 200 products
- Over 20 components
- Search bar (MUI auto complete)
- Shopping cart
- Responsive carousel
- Paging

## Pages.

The <b>home</b> page lists the specials that the site has to offer, similar to what you'd see online, it's basically a navigation page/entry point for the current specials and the other 2 pages.

The <b>category</b> page lists all the products for a particular category of shoes depending what URL you come in on. eg: mens, womens, kids.

The <b>product</b> page displays all the details about an individual product.
